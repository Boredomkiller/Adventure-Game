Created a series of dialogue loops to railroad the player around a mock fantasy world. 

Each Y/N choice gives the player the option to opt out of adventuring life at any point. 

Items can be obtained along their journey.

Two difficulty rated starter adventures.

Rodents of unusual size - Easy
Goblins - Difficult if solo (Ends in death if the fight is pushed)
